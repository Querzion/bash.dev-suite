# bash.development
Arch bash script to install some of the development tools that I end up using sometimes. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Querzion/bash.development.git $HOME
```
```bash
chmod +x -r $HOME/bash.development
```
```bash
sh $HOME/bash.development/installer.sh
```
### This script installs, a small slew of packages. 
  -  vscode
  -  dotnet-sdk
  -  python
  -  nodejs
  -  npm
  -  pip
  -  Maybe more, check the ../files/packages.txt file.
